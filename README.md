# Tracking Application

Looking to create an application to track tasks, times, pomodoros, etc.

Key feature will be tree-like task organization with time tracking flowing up to parent tasks.

Would like to support queries like:
>How many hours did I spend studying in university?
>What university assignment took me the longest to complete?
>How long did I spend tidying the apartment this year?
